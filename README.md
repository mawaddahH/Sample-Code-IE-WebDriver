# Sample-Code-IE-WebDriver
assignment 1 W7D4 - SDA - Software QA Bootcamp

Because the IE browser was stopped,
# I decided to use Microsoft Edge Driver.

First:
Setup Latest Driver for Microsoft Edge Driver.
- check the latest version of Edge

Second:
- download the WebDriver from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
